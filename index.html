            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div>
            <p>I am in the middle of an exciting career change to become a Full Stack Developer.</p>
            <p>After graduating in Biology at Leeds, I completed an MSc in Ecology at York and then a PhD at Cambridge. I have since worked as a technical specialist and a manager in the environmental sector, where I gained a wide range of experience and skills, such as in project management, data analysis, problem-solving, clear written and verbal communication and working collaboratively with others.</p>
            <p>I have been privileged with my career so far but I am now ready for a completely new challenge and the opportunity to pursue my passion for coding. I have always been fascinated by technology, and my first experience with coding was teaching myself C to allow me to create computer models for my PhD.</p>
            <p>I have already made big strides towards my new goals. Whilst retraining in my own time as a Full Stack Developer, I transitioned into the technology sector, working for Dronecloud &#8212; a Software as a Service flight management system for drones. I have been able to use my existing transferable skills as well as my proactive self-led approach to learning new skills, covering business analyst, software testing and project management roles to assist in delivery of a large project to integrate software across three independent companies. This has been invaluable experience of working within a software development environment, and I was even able to contribute some code of my own to the development team in my own time.</p>
            <blockquote>"Tom has been awesome in his time here with us at Dronecloud. He brought a huge amount of experience and skills as well as a capability to quickly pick up new skills on his own. Tom fit really well into the team and was instrumental in making Project Rise such a success!"<span>Jan Domaradzki, CEO Dronecloud</span></blockquote>
            <p>I am based in Hertfordshire in the UK, and I am available for work.</p>
